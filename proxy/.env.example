# Proxy backend environment variables

# Server port used for local testing (does not affect the Cloudflare Worker)
# Example: 3000
PORT=3000

# Node environment (development or production)
NODE_ENV=development

#
# Cloudflare / Wrangler related values (for CI and local wrangler commands)
# These values are normally provided as CI secrets (GitHub Actions) and
# should NOT be committed with real tokens. Keep the placeholders here.
#
# CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID: Your Cloudflare account id (required by `wrangler publish`)
# CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN: A scoped API token with permissions to publish Workers
# WORKER_NAME: Optional - the name of the worker script to deploy (if different)
#
# Example (replace with your real values in CI/Secrets):
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=00000000000000000000000000000000
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=changeme_do_not_commit
WORKER_NAME=saps-firearm-proxy

# Note for GitHub Actions:
# - Add `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to repository secrets.
# - The workflows will reference these secrets when running `wrangler publish`.
