# API Base URL for the proxy backend
# Must include protocol. For local dev use the local proxy port (example below).
# In production set this to your deployed Cloudflare Worker URL, e.g.:
#   https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev
# or a custom domain if you configured one.
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: If you deploy to GitHub Pages under a repository path, set the base
# path (starts and ends with a slash). Vite uses this when building.
# Example: /SAPS-Firearm-Status-Enquiry-PWA/
# Leave empty for root.
VITE_BASE_PATH=

# Notes:
# - Environment variables used by Vite must start with `VITE_`.
# - Do NOT commit secrets to the repo. The frontend only needs the public
#   worker URL (no tokens).
